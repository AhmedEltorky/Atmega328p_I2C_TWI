# Atmega328p_I2C_TWI

### Two Wire Interface between three atmega328p microcontrollers one master and two slaves, master read data from one slave and write it into the other slave.
### The master and slave_write microcontrollers used polling technique and slave_read microcontroller used interrupt technique.

#### I2C: Inter-Integrated Circuit
#### TWI: Two Wire Interface
